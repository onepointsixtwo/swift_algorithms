        To build our map heap, we basically just call heapify multiple times, starting from the lowest layer of nodes which have children.
        This is calculated as the length / 2 - 1. Again, this is pretty easy to see when you draw out an actual tree - this will always give the last node
        in the layer which has children (prior to the layer which is solely leaf nodes).
        We then iterate backwards through the nodes calling heapify to make sure each layer is ordered correctly. At the end we will have a correctly ordered max heap.

                This took me a minute to understand, but it's actually really simple. Because it's a binary tree, and we know that each node can have a max of two children, then we know that
                the children for a node always reside at a point that is double it's own array index + 1.
                You can draw this out and it becomes really obvious.
                So for the array 10 | 8 | 3 | 7 | 5 | 1 which is actually already a max heap, the tree representation would be
                          10
                         /  \
                        8    3
                       / \
                      7   5
             So using the below formula, the children for 10 (index 0) should be at 2 * 0 + 1 and 2*0 + 2 which they are (indexes 1 and 2 respectively).
             Likewise, for 8 (at index 1) the children should be at 2 * 1 + 1 (3) and 2 * 1 + 2 (4) which they are (array[3] == 7 and array[4] == 5)
